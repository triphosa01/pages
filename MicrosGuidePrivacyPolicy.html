  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information the <em>Guide to Micro Moths of GB&amp;I</em> app collects, how that information is used and shared, and the choices available to you. By installing or using the app you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Summary — Key points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> require user accounts or sign-in.</li>
      <li>The app collects no personal user data except for non-personal usage analytics.</li>
      <li>Usage analytics are shared with Google Analytics and contain only an app-generated device identifier (a GUID) — no names, email addresses, or other personal identifiers are collected by the app.</li>
      <li>You are asked to agree to analytics collection when using the app. You can change your choice any time from the Help section of the app using the provided button.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Analytics (usage data)</strong></p>
    <p>The only information collected by the app is anonymous usage analytics intended to help improve the app. Analytics data includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An app-generated device identifier (GUID) that the app creates to recognise a device for analytics purposes.</li>
      <li>Non-personal usage events such as which screens or filters are used, feature usage counts, and general performance metrics (app crashes, load times etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Importantly, the app does not collect or transmit personal identifiers such as your name, email address, phone number, contacts, precise device identifiers that identify you personally, or location data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How we use the information</h2>
    <p>The analytics data is used only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how the app is used (which features are used and how often).</li>
      <li>Detect and fix crashes and other technical issues.</li>
      <li>Improve user experience and performance over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>The app shares analytics data with Google Analytics (or Google Analytics for Firebase as implemented for Android). The analytics information shared with Google does not include personal information — it contains the app-generated GUID and the usage events described above.</p>
    <p>Google’s own collection, storage and processing of analytics data is subject to Google’s privacy policy and terms. We do not control Google’s policies; please see Google’s documentation for details about their data handling and retention options.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Consent &amp; opt-out</h2>
    <p>On first use the app will ask you to agree to usage analytics. Analytics collection is consent-based. If you do not agree, analytics will not be collected for your installation.</p>
    <p>If you previously agreed and want to change your choice, open the app, go to the <strong>Help</strong> section and tap the analytics consent button to enable or disable analytics at any time. Disabling analytics will stop new analytics data from being collected from your device; previously collected analytics data may remain with the analytics provider until it is removed according to their retention policies — you may contact us if you want us to request deletion of previously collected analytics data associated with your device GUID (see "Contact" below).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>User accounts</h2>
    <p>The app does not provide user accounts or require sign-in. No user account information is collected or stored by the app.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>Analytics data is retained only as long as necessary to provide analytics and improve the app. If you ask us to delete analytics data tied to your device GUID we will take reasonable steps to request deletion from the analytics provider. Because analytics processing is handled by a third party (Google), deletion timeframes may depend on their retention policies; contact us for assistance and we will act promptly.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use generally accepted technical and organizational measures to protect analytics data from unauthorized access and misuse. However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure; if you have concerns about security please contact us (see below).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed at children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information via the app, please contact us and we will take steps to delete that information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If material changes are made, we will provide notice in the app or via this page. The effective date is shown below.</p>
  </section>
