    <p>The interactive Spreadsheet edition of the Field Guide is an Excel Spreadsheet application that uses macros. Your computer will consider these as a security threat. As such the spreadsheet needs to be "trusted" by Excel.</p>

    <p>Normally Clicking on "Enable Content" will be all that is required, but it is possible to set up the "trust|" through the Excel Trust Center.</p>

    <p>Below are the steps required to establish this "trust".</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Create a new folder such as Documents/MothsGuide</li>
        <li>Open Excel and navigate to File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Centre</li>
        <li>Click on the Trust Center Settings button and then "Trusted locations"</li>
        <li>Click on "Add new location", Browse to your new folder and click OK</li>
        <li>Right-click the link at the end of these instructions to download the macro-enabled spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>Move or copy the file from the Downloads folder to your new folder</li>
        <li>Open the spreadsheet from that folder.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you receive a message about ActiveX then go to the "ActiveX Settings" section in the Trust Center. Select the "Prompt me before enabling all controls" option.</p>
