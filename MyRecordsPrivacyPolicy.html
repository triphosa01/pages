  <h1>Privacy Policy for MyRecords</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 10 November 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Triphosa Apps<br>
     <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:triphosa01@gmail.com">triphosa01@gmail.com</a></p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>MyRecords (“the App”) is developed to help users view their current GPS location and record information associated with that location. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information when you use it.</p>
    <p>By using MyRecords, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>a. Location Data</h3>
    <p>The App accesses your device’s GPS location to display your current position as an OS grid reference (within the UK) or as latitude and longitude coordinates (outside the UK).</p>
    <p>When you first use the App, <strong>Android will ask for your permission to allow MyRecords to access your device’s location</strong>. You can choose whether to grant or deny this permission. The App cannot determine your position or save a location-based record without it.</p>
    <p>Location data is processed <strong>only on your device</strong> and is <strong>never transmitted or shared</strong> with the developer or any third parties.</p>

    <h3>b. User-Entered Information</h3>
    <p>You can enter your own notes or information as part of each record. These records are stored locally in daily CSV files in your device’s Documents folder. You have full control over these files and can open, share, or delete them as you wish. No record content is uploaded or shared externally.</p>

    <h3>c. Analytics Data (Firebase)</h3>
    <p>MyRecords uses <strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous usage information that helps understand how the app is used and to improve its performance.</p>
    <p>The data collected includes information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>App version and interactions with app screens and features</li>
      <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
      <li>Crash reports and performance metrics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Firebase Analytics automatically generates an <strong>App Instance ID</strong> to differentiate anonymous app installations. This ID is not linked to any personally identifiable information and does not allow the developer to identify individual users.</p>
    <p>Analytics data is processed by Google in aggregated form and is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Display your current location within the app.</li>
      <li>Save and manage your location-based records locally.</li>
      <li>Improve app performance and stability through aggregated analytics and crash reports.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>The developer does not share, sell, or transmit any personal or location data. Usage analytics are processed by Google Firebase as described above, in accordance with Google’s privacy and security practices.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All user records are stored locally on your device. You have complete control over your data and may delete it at any time. The developer does not have access to or store any user-generated content.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location (GPS):</strong> Required to determine and display your current position. Android will ask you to grant this permission before the App can access your location.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage (read/write):</strong> Used to save your CSV records in your Documents folder.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for the functionality described above.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>MyRecords is not intended for children under 13 years of age and does not knowingly collect any personal information from them.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>View, open, and delete your locally stored CSV records.</li>
      <li>Manage or revoke location permission at any time through your device’s Settings.</li>
      <li>Uninstalling the App will delete all stored data and stop any analytics collection from that device.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by the “Effective date” above. Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the revised policy.</p>
